		<p>This is a tool that can be embedded on any website (e.g. an organization website, a blog, a news site) in a single line of code:</p>
		<script src="https://climatewidget.netlify.app/dist.js"></script>
		<p>The point is to help people onboard the climate movement.  When users submit the form, they can receive:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>An automatic email introducing them to local direct action organizers (e.g. local XR chapter, Declare Emergency, mutual aid groups)</li>
			<li>Guidance for leading transitions in their own communities.  For example, emails focused on things like:
				<ul style="margin-bottom: 8px">
					<li>Gathering with neighbors and building community</li>
					<li>Transitioning to car-free places</li>
					<li>Building food/energy/water resilience</li>
					<li>Political mobilization</li>
					<li>Systems change</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
			<li>Any other information, guides, resources that could be useful.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>This lifts all boats and benefits all groups that participate.  If a New Yorker visits a Los Angeles website and fills out the form, it will connect the reader with relevant resources for New York.  If an Angeleno visits a NY website and fills out the form, it will connect the reader with relevant resources for LA.</p>
		<!-- <p>Notably, this can be implemented anywhere, and give global benefits.  For example, organizations in New York and Paris could each utilize this tool on their website.</p> -->
		<!-- <p>If a Parisian visits the New York website and fills out the form, it will connect the Parisian with relevant resources for Paris.  If an New Yorker visits the Paris website and fills out the form, it will connect the reader with relevant resources for New York.</p> -->
		<p>The point is helping people engage and onboard with local action overall â€” and doing so in a way, that connects people with the contexts most useful to them, wherever they access the form.</p>
